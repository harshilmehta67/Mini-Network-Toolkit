Our project is a mini network management toolkit which allows its users to perform some network related functions and monitoring activity. The point of such a toolkit is to ease the pain of managing the network administrators so that they would not need large and complex softwares just to perform some basic housekeeping.
- Some features of our toolkit are:
  - Fetching the system information.
  - Fetching the Interface Table and the Routing table of the machine.
  - Viewing the connections made by internet sockets and/or unix sockets
  - Capturing and viewing ICMP, TCP and UDP packets
  - Testing whether an IP address or a set of IP addresses are active or unreachable
  - Tracing the path taken by a packet during its journey to the provided machine

Firstly, to install all the dependencies, you need to have a version of python pip(python3:pip3 used here)

``` pip3 install -r requirements.txt ```
